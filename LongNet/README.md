# LongNet Implementation Research Document

## System Analysis

The LongNet architecture is based on the Transformers but with a twist to handle longer sequences. Its foundation is on the self-attention mechanism that maps a query and a set of keys and values to output. However, self-attention struggles with longer sequences due to its quadratic dependency on sequence length, which leads to computational inefficiencies.

To resolve this, LongNet introduces the Dilated Attention method that splits the input into equally sized segments. Each segment is then sparsified along the sequence dimension by selecting the rows with a certain interval. The computation can be written as per the provided equations.

Dilated attention reduces the computation cost significantly over vanilla attention. In practice, the segment size trades the globality of attention for efficiency, while the dilation with a certain size reduces the computation cost by approximating the attention matrix.

To capture both long-range and short-range information efficiently, a mixture of dilated attentions with different segment sizes and dilation rates is implemented.

LongNet also incorporates the multi-head attention mechanism, with each head having a distinct offset when selecting the query-key-value pairs.

## Algorithmic Pseudocode

The following is a high-level pseudocode for the LongNet model:

```python
class LongNet:
    Initialize parameters for LongNet

    def dilated_attention(self, input):
        # Split the input into segments
        input_segments = split(input)
        
        # Sparsify each segment along the sequence dimension
        sparsified_segments = sparsify(input_segments)
        
        # Feed sparsified segments into attention
        attended_segments = attention(sparsified_segments)
        
        # Scatter and concatenate the segments as output
        output = scatter_and_concatenate(attended_segments)
        
        return output

    def multi_head_dilated_attention(self, input):
        # For each head
        for head in heads:
            # Offset the query-key-value pairs
            offset_qkv = offset(head)
            
            # Perform dilated attention
            output = self.dilated_attention(offset_qkv)
        
        # Concatenate the outputs of different heads
        final_output = concatenate(output)
        
        return final_output

    def forward(self, input):
        output = self.multi_head_dilated_attention(input)
        return output
```

## Actual Code

Now, let's implement the LongNet model using PyTorch.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.nn import MultiheadAttention

class DilatedAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, dilation_rate, segment_size):
        super(DilatedAttention, self).__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.dilation_rate = dilation_rate
        self.segment_size = segment_size
        self.attention = MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=d_model, num_heads=num_heads)

    def forward(self, x):
        batch_size, seq_len, _ = x.shape

        # Split and sparsify
        x = x.view(batch_size, -1, self.segment_size, self.d_model)
        x = x[:, :, ::self.dilation_rate, :]

        # Perform attention
        attn_output, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)

        # Scatter and concatenate
        attn_output = attn_output.view(batch_size, -1, self.d_model)
        return attn_output

```



# Multi-Modal Dilation Attention
Creating a multi-modal version of DilatedAttention involves extending the attention mechanism to handle input from multiple modalities (e.g., text, audio, video) simultaneously. This involves processing each modality with its own dedicated attention mechanism and then combining the results in a meaningful way.

Here's an architectural overview, requirements, simplifications, optimizations, pseudocode, and implementation for this:

## Architectural Overview
In a multi-modal DilatedAttention, we first apply individual DilatedAttention modules to each modality. The outputs of these modules are then concatenated along the feature dimension, resulting in a tensor that includes attention features from all modalities. Finally, another DilatedAttention module is applied to the concatenated features, allowing cross-modality interactions to be captured.

## Requirements
1. Individual attention mechanisms for each modality that understand the modality-specific data.
2. Mechanism to concatenate the modality-specific attention outputs.
3. Final attention mechanism that captures the cross-modality interactions.
4. Variable modality support, as not all modalities might be available for every data point.

## Simplifications
1. All modalities are treated independently until the final concatenation and cross-modality attention step.
2. Modality-specific attention mechanisms are assumed to be capable of handling their respective data types.
3. The architecture is flexible with the number and types of modalities. It can work even if one or more modalities are missing.

## Optimizations
1. Parallel Processing: Since the modality-specific attention computations are independent, they can be performed in parallel, leading to significant speedup.
2. Dynamic Computation: If a modality is not available for a certain data point, its computation can be skipped.
3. Attention Reduction: If the cross-modality attention proves too expensive, you could reduce the number of attention heads or lower the dimensionality of the attention space.

## Pseudocode

```pseudocode
function MULTIMODAL_DILATED_ATTENTION(input_modality_data):
    for each modality in input_modality_data:
        apply DILATED_ATTENTION to modality data
    concatenate all modality attention outputs
    apply CROSS_MODALITY_ATTENTION to concatenated outputs
    return cross_modality_attention_outputs
end function
```

## Python Implementation with PyTorch
I will use the MultiwayNetwork that you've shared as a starting point, which serves as a wrapper that can process different splits of data separately.

```python
class MultiModalDilatedAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout=0.0, causal=False, num_modalities=2):
        super(MultiModalDilatedAttention, self).__init__()

        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_modalities = num_modalities
        self.dilated_attns = nn.ModuleList(
            [DilatedAttention(d_model, num_heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout, causal) for _ in range(num_modalities)]
        )
        self.cross_modality_attn = DilatedAttention(num_modalities * d_model, num_heads, dilation_rate, segment_size, dropout, causal)

    def forward(self, x):
        modality_outputs = []
        for modality_data, attn in zip(x, self.dilated_attns):
            modality_outputs.append(attn(modality_data))

        cross_modality_input = torch.cat(modality_outputs, dim=-1)
        cross_modality_output = self.cross_modality_attn(cross_modality_input)

        return cross_modality_output
```
In this Python implementation, `x` is expected to be a list of tensors, each corresponding to a different modality. The `DilatedAttention` mechanism is applied to each modality independently, and the results are then concatenated and passed through a final `DilatedAttention` mechanism to capture cross-modality interactions.

Please note that this is a fairly straightforward extension of DilatedAttention to multiple modalities and might require further enhancements to optimally deal with multi-modal data. For instance, attention normalization or scaling might be needed when concatenating modality-specific attention outputs. The choice of the final cross-modality attention mechanism could also be modified as per the needs of your specific application.
